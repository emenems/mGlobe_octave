### mGlobe  
**Modelling of global mass effects in hydrology, atmosphere and oceans on surface gravity**

This toolbox allows user to compute:  
* global hydrological,
* atmospheric,
* non-tidal ocean loading effects _on surface gravity_  

No test data were uploaded with this code because of
provider's conditions of use.   
The links to all supported models
are listed in the [user manual](https://github.com/emenems/mGlobe/blob/master/USER_MANUAL/mGlobe_user_guide.md) file. Please read this
