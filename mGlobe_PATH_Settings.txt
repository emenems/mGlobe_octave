% Set path to folders containing global hydrological (GHM), ocean bottom pressure (OBPM)
% and GRACE models. Use either relative or absolute path (relative path was used in 
% previous version of mGlobe).
% Set MODEL>PATH 
%	Example1 	for relative path used in previous version of mGlobe:
% 				GHM>GHM 
%				-> this means the mGlobe repository contains GHM sub-folder
%				with all models (CLM, MOS,... sub-folders)
% 	Example2	for absolute path to OBPM use:
%				OBPM>C:\Data\OBPM
GHM>GHM
OBPM>OBPM
GRACE>GRACE
